# MINDly  
**Headlines for a healthier mind.**  

MINDly is a cross-platform mobile application built with React Native and backed by a Python Flask REST API.
The backend integrates with NewsAPI to fetch real-time articles, which are then processed through a custom NLP-based filtering algorithm that classifies and removes negative or harmful content. Only positive, feel-good stories are exposed to the client, ensuring a curated and mentally healthier news feed.
By combining API-driven content aggregation, algorithmic filtering, and a mobile-first UX, MINDly delivers an alternative news consumption experience optimized for mental well-being.

> According to a Grow Therapy survey, **99.6% of therapists believe news consumption negatively impacts mental health**.  
> MINDly is designed to change that.
